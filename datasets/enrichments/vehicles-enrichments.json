Popular conversion builders include Thor (Sanctuary line), Grech RV (STRADA-ion AWD with 250 AMP alternator, 3000W inverter, 300W solar), Wildworx, and Adventure Wagon. Key technical specs: Mercedes AWD maintains same ground clearance as previous 4x4 system. True 4x4 requires center and rear diff locks minimum (not just AWD). Consider Iveco Daily 4x4 as alternative with 3 locking diffs and reduction gearbox for serious off-road."

Rarity: Estimated only 30 survivors worldwide. Designed for French oil exploration in Algerian Sahara. Each engine operates independently with own ignition, carburetor, gearbox, fuel supply.

System types: Ducted systems distribute air through ceiling vents (better for larger motorhomes), non-ducted blow directly from ceiling assembly (good for smaller campers). Sizing: 13,500-15,000 BTU for travel trailers and smaller motorhomes, dual units or higher capacity for larger motorhomes. Cool My Camper offers refrigerant-based split pack systems as cost-effective alternative to water-cooled or thermoelectric.
