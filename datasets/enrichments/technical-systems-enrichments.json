      "extra_info": "Dual wheels (also called dualies or twin wheels) distribute weight better on paved roads and provide redundancy if one tire fails. However, they create more ground pressure on soft surfaces because the two tires on each side create a narrow 'track' rather than spreading load. Most expedition and overland motorhomes avoid dual wheels for this reason. Recovery requires lifting both tires simultaneously or placing boards under both wheels."

LPG is widely available in most European countries except parts of Scandinavia. Cost typically ranges from €0.50-0.90 per liter."

Temperature differentials (especially during storage or winter) can cause small cracks to expand rapidly. Cost of replacement varies: €200-600 for standard motorhomes, €400-1000+ for vehicles with lane-keeping assist or HUD systems requiring calibration."

Common entry points include degraded O-rings, loose connections, and hairline cracks in fuel lines. The bleeding procedure typically involves: 1) Crack open bleed screws on fuel filter, 2) Use hand primer pump until fuel flows bubble-free, 3) Tighten bleed screws, 4) Start engine and run until smooth. Permatex PermaShield ($8-12) is the gold standard sealant for diesel systems. If air keeps returning, inspect all connections with clear tubing segments to visually identify bubbles."

Key consideration: Lithium batteries require temperature management - most cannot charge below 5°C (41°F). Solutions include batteries with internal heating (premium models), insulated battery boxes with heating pads, or placement in climate-controlled areas. A 400Ah @ 24V system provides approximately 10kWh usable capacity, sufficient to run refrigerator, lights, water pump, and occasional AC loads for 2-3 days without charging."

      "extra_info": "Electric water heaters (1500W) are simple but require substantial battery capacity (400Ah+ recommended for off-grid use) or shore power. Diesel heaters like Eberspächer Hydronic are more fuel-efficient and don't drain batteries, but require professional installation (fuel line tap, exhaust routing, coolant loop). The Hydronic S3 provides modulating 1.3-5kW output, can heat both air (via blower units) and water (via heat exchanger), and uses approximately 0.12-0.51 L/hour of diesel. Many modern motorhomes use hybrid systems: electric when on shore power, diesel when off-grid."

      "extra_info": "Solar panels eliminate generator noise and fuel costs while providing silent, clean power. A 305W panel is often the largest that fits between roof features (vents, AC units, antennas). For maximum output, install multiple panels: 2x 200W or 3x 150W can provide 400-600W total capacity. Essential components: UV-resistant mounting brackets (avoid drilling when possible), waterproof entry gland for roof penetration, MPPT charge controller (Victron, Renogy), and appropriate gauge cables. Expected output: 300W panel produces approximately 1.2-1.8 kWh per day in good conditions, sufficient to offset refrigerator and basic loads."

Three main types: 1) Mechanical switches on battery terminal (simple, reliable), 2) Quick disconnects (convenient but can bend/fail), 3) Panel-mounted heavy-duty switch (best accessibility). Recommended approach: Install main disconnect in accessible control panel (275A+ rating) plus mega-fuse near battery as backup. Proper sizing critical: 100A minimum for small systems, 200-275A for systems with inverters. Always disconnect negative terminal first when working on electrical systems."

Key feature: calculates exact height adjustment needed per wheel in real-time. Particularly valuable for truck-based motorhomes where the cab and living quarters are separate units connected by flexible chassis - you can check leveling from the cab via smartphone before getting out. Operates in extreme temperatures (-40°F to 185°F). Alternative: traditional bubble levels and manual leveling blocks/ramps."

Best practices: 1) Pour hot water into gray tank in evening (instead of morning showers) to maintain temperature overnight, 2) Use diesel heating to warm water, 3) In extreme cold, keep gray valve open (non-legal in some areas but prevents tank freezing - wastewater drains directly), 4) Ensure fresh water tanks are in heated/insulated areas. Gray water discharge outlets typically located at rear bumper. Legal considerations: Gray water disposal regulations vary by country - some allow roadside disposal, others require designated dump stations. Always check local regulations."
