The air gap cools the roof more than it cools the panel itself, but overall system efficiency improves. Proper ventilation prevents panel overheating which can reduce output and shorten lifespan. This is especially critical for flexible panels which can overheat when glued directly to insulating roof surfaces."

O2 Germany Prepaid: 999GB for €75/month covering entire EU, no auto-renewal. Phone number preserved for 1 year without recharge. Reload via internet, O2 app, or kiosk/gas station. Auto-switch from Starlink to eSIM when connection fails. Starlink better in remote areas, eSIM better for backup and urban areas. Tree blockage affects Starlink - reposition antenna via mobile app (usually <1 minute). Roof mounting with ball joint improves reliability."

Waze Disadvantages: No vehicle dimension support, unreliable routing (non-existent roads, prohibited turns), no offline capability, slower route recalculation vs Google/HERE, data quality issues. HERE recommended for European motorhome travel due to offline reliability in rural areas with poor cellular coverage. Download maps before travel for offline use and data savings."

Basic plan: ~€50/month ($50 USD) for 50GB data. Additional data: €18. Can freeze/suspend plan during off-travel periods. High power consumer - critical planning parameter for solar-living motorhomes. 90% reliability for messaging/communication. Signal strength varies but communication maintained even with weak signal."

Argentina cellular: 40GB=$25/60 days. Management strategies: 1) Turn off Starlink when not needed, 2) Use cellular when available (cheaper than overage), 3) Disable auto-updates, 4) Manually close apps after use, 5) Turn off WiFi on inactive devices, 6) Monitor app network access in settings. Example: User consumed 40GB in 7 days on WiFi vs normal cellular usage."
