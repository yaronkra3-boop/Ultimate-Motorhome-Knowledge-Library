Digital nomad visas available in some countries (Spain, Portugal, Estonia) allow longer stays. Overstaying can result in entry bans (1-5 years), fines (€500-€1000+), and deportation.

NEW 2025: Gas system test (DVGW G 607) mandatory every 2 years for LPG motorhomes (€40-80). SMART STRATEGY for extended travel: Register in Germany or France, then leave country - testing NOT required until re-entry. Real example: 5+ years travel outside Europe with German registration, no testing during entire period. ZOLL/TRANSIT number (temporary export): Requires customs documentation, import process on return, potentially triggers taxes - NOT recommended for regular European return. Better option: German/French registration allows 7+ years European travel without testing while abroad. Insurance (e.g., AXA Schengen) auto-renews annually even when vehicle outside Europe. Only requirement: Testing when re-entering registration country."

Applies to ALL non-EU nationals including Israelis and Americans. EVERY person in motorhome must go through biometric process at first entry (including children). System automatically tracks 90/180-day limit - no more manual counting. Border crossings (tunnels, ferries) will take significantly longer, especially in early months. Countries NOT covered: Ireland, Cyprus, UK. Data retained: 3 years (compliant travelers) or 5 years (overstayers). System expected fully operational by April 10, 2026. Progressive rollout across 29 European countries over 6-month period. Children under 12 exempt from fingerprints but need facial scan. Prepare for longer wait times at borders and ensure all passengers have valid passports."

Vehicle registered in YOUR name, German address for mail only. REAL EXAMPLE (Ilan): Israeli friend with German citizenship in small city near Cologne acted as co-signer. Vehicle registered in Ilan's name. ADAC insurance: €800/year (€50K vehicle, all coverage). Extended to multiple drivers after 5 months: +€36 only. Windshield replaced in Spain - reimbursed in 2 hours minus €150 deductible. Successfully traveled Spain to Morocco with German registration + Portuguese passport. Ferry Tangier crossing: 50 minutes, very straightforward. IMPORTANT: German co-signer must be trustworthy (receives your mail). ADAC recommended - excellent service, not profit-driven (sponsoring organization, not private insurer)."

Caspian Sea ferry available for motorhome crossing. MOROCCO: Israeli citizens require eVisa before travel (not visa-on-arrival). Apply at least 3 weeks before departure. Valid passport 6+ months required. Ferry Spain-Tangier: 50-minute crossing, straightforward. HISTORIC ROUTE (2013): Turkey → Georgia → Russia → Kyrgyzstan → Kazakhstan → Mongolia (all passable then). 2024-2025: Turkey avoided, alternative routing through Caucasus. RESOURCES: Horizons Unlimited (horizonsunlimited.com), Caravanistan guides. Border interactions can be challenging (tension, potential corruption). Israeli passport has advantages in some regions, European passport better in others. Multiple currencies and documentation required."
